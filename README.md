#### A.	Project Background and Description 
This app is intended for making appointments with a personal psychiatrist for a patient through a simple portal. Depending on the availability of the psychiatrist, you choose your appointment of a different date and time that suits you and him/her best. The app offers different conditions and symptoms that prior allow the psychiatrist to plan her meeting when chosen by the patient. The psychiatrist can view the appointments on the dashboard of all his/her patients.

#### B.	Project Scope 
This web app will be implemented via a responsive website that will allow making of appointments/bookings for a patient. Choosing from a list of conditions and sending them according to the psychiatrist availability; who in turn can view all the appointments. The web app is not inclusive of online meets/videoconferencing but rather just scheduling physical meets from web portal. It will also assume payments will be negotiated when the two parties meet. 

#### C.	High-Level Requirements 
The app/system is should allow patients to make bookings from their emails, chose a date and time and maybe a condition. It should offer all the listing of all appointments to the psychiatrist on her end. 

#### D.	Deliverables 
The final customers (psychiatrist and the patients) will get a web app with a nice intuitive design, good user experience with guides. Easy navigation and some prototypes for demonstration. Additional user requirements and functionalities will be accepted and integrated if required.

#### E.	Affected Parties 
A psychiatrist and his/her patients are the target of the application. They will be no other party.

#### F.	Implementation Plan 
I will start off with designs from Figma online tool to showcase the portal. Thereafter, make necessary installations for the development with VS Code and git version control. The next part will be building the site while testing. The final part will be deploying the app for accessibility from any browser.

#### G.	High-Level Timeline/Schedule 
There is a two-month timeframe to implement this system from its kick-off.
